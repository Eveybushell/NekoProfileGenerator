# NekoProfileGenerator

## How to use

This is a website for generating a neko or "cat people" picture or gif for the use of profile pictures on other sites.<br>
Click on the button labeled "Give me a random picture" to generate a .jpg or .png image. <br>
Click on the button labeled "Give me a random gif" to generate a .gif moving image.

## Reasoning

I chose this API because I thought it was a little funny to have an entire API dedicated to neko pictures and because there are a lot of profile pictures with anime in them online.<br>
The biggest challenge I had was realizing the API didn't have an innate breakpoint for generating either a random picture or a random gif.
They were all split into a wide selection of separate categories so I needed to wrangle some more code together to create what I would have thought was a basic functionality.
